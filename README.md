FPS Mods:

Located inside the ultrawide folders.
I will always try to add 120 FPS or more when possible.

Resolution Mods:

Located inside the ultrawide folders.
I will always try to add up to 4K/8K resolution when possible.
Mods are optimized for a resolution of 3440x1440. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated.

All the files inside mods folder are necessary, some mods contains cheats file, pchtxt file and V2.pchtxt files, dont delete any of these.
